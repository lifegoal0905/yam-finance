# Rust Guide

This is a guide to using the Ockam Rust SDK. Over the course of four examples, the guide builds a distributed echo service
that forwards messages between nodes.

The [Get Started](/learn/how-to-guides/rust/get-started) guide walks developers through the fundamentals of using
Ockam in a rust project.

In [Step 1](/learn/how-to-guides/rust/01-workers) we build a basic Ockam node and worker. The core data types and traits that comprise
the Ockam API are introduced, along with the asynchronous runtime.

[Step 2](/learn/how-to-guides/rust/02-transports) introduces Ockam transports and message routing. The Ockam TCP transport is used to
send messages between two nodes.

The Ockam Hub is a remote node that can send, receive, and route messages between nodes. [Step 3](/learn/how-to-guides/rust/03-hub)
shows you how to use the TCP transport to send messages to a node hosted on the Hub.

Message forwarding is discussed in [Step 4](/learn/how-to-guides/rust/04-forwarding), enabling you to route messages between remote nodes.
