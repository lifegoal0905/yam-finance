# Enterprise

Developers want their tools to work well and to integrate easily. That's why Ockam works with [enterprise partners](/learn/concepts/enterprise-systems/) to develop turn-key solutions.

See how Ockam provides end-to-end encryption to InfluxDB and InfluxCloud users with `ockamd`, our configurable daemon:
- [Secure Communication Between Telegraf and InfluxDB with OckamD](/learn/how-to-guides/using-add-ons/enterprise/influxdb/telegraf-influxdb-with-ockamd)

Expect new Ockam Add-ons to keep rolling out over the next several months.
Next up is an Ockam Add-on for Confluent Kafka. Stay tuned.
